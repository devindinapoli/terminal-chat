# Terminal Chat

A NodeJS application using the Pusher Chatkit.

To run the application:

```npm install``` in the root directory.

Run ```node server.js``` to start the server.

Next, in a seperate terminal window/tab, run ```node client.js```.

Follow the prompt, and start chatting!

PS. If you don't have anyone to chat with, just open a third window/tab on your terminal and run ```node client.js```, create a new username, and join a room to start talking to yourself!
